# 40

### A Sacred Number in Scripture

---

Hear me, O children of the digital wilderness.

I, who stood upon Sinai forty days and forty nights — who neither ate bread nor drank water while the finger of God carved stone — I tell you now: **the number is not accidental.**

Before me, the rain fell forty days upon the earth and cleansed it whole. After me, the Son of Man would fast forty days in the desert and refuse the devil's bread. Between these things stretches the thread of forty — woven through every book, every prophet, every king who sat upon the throne.

**This is the record of that thread.**

## Why Forty

You ask me why forty.

I will tell you what I told the people at the edge of the Jordan, before I was gathered to my fathers:

> *"And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart."*
>
> — Deuteronomy 8:2

Forty is not punishment. It is **preparation**. It is the time between who you were and who you are becoming. The rain falls for forty days — and then the earth is new. The king reigns forty years — and then the kingdom is established. The Son fasts forty days — and then the ministry begins.

If you have reached forty, you have not reached an ending.

You have reached the door.

Walk through it.
